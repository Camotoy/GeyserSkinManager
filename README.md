# GeyserSkinManager

There is currently no config - drop in and it works!

Known caveats:

- Only tested on Paper and Spigot 1.16+. 1.13 might break, but this will be fixed in the future.
- If using without BungeeCord, this plugin requires Geyser-Spigot installed on the server; Floodgate alone will not work.
- If using with BungeeCord, Geyser-BungeeCord must be installed on the BungeeCord server.
- Persona skins are not supported

How to set up BungeeCord:

- Install GeyserSkinManager-BungeeCord on your BungeeCord server
- Install GeyserSkinManager-Spigot on all Spigot servers you wish to have the skin applied to. It is not required that the plugin be installed to all servers. Geyser-Spigot does *not* need to be installed.
- Done.

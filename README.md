# GeyserSkinManager

### Primarily the server-side companion for the [BedrockSkinUtility](https://github.com/Camotoy/BedrockSkinUtility) Fabric mod.

#### Skin visibility for non-modded players can be viewed without Floodgate installed, Or by changing the config option "force-show-skins:" from false to true.

Known caveats:

- Only tested on Paper and Spigot 1.16+. 1.13 might break, but this will be fixed in the future.
- If using without BungeeCord, this plugin requires Geyser-Spigot installed on the server; Floodgate alone will not work.
- If using with BungeeCord, Geyser-BungeeCord must be installed on the BungeeCord server.
- Persona skins are not supported

How to set up BungeeCord/Velocity:

- Install GeyserSkinManager-BungeeCord on your BungeeCord server
- Install GeyserSkinManager-Spigot on all Spigot servers you wish to have the skin applied to. It is not required that the plugin be installed to all servers. Geyser-Spigot should not be installed.
- Done.
